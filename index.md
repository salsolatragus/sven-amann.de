I am PhD student in the Code Recommenders subgroup of the [Software Technology Group][1] at TU Darmstadt.

  * 2013–now, TU Darmstadt, PhD student, advised by Mira Mezini
  * 2012, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, exchange student
  * 2009–2013, TU Darmstadt, master's degree
  * 2006–2009, TU Darmstadt, bachelor's degree

My general research interests include: developer-assistance tools, bug detection, mining software repositories, and software testing.
I lead [the Eko Software Campus project][2], in which we build [MuDetect][3], a developer-assistance tool that finds API misuses, i.e., incorrect or non-optimal usages of APIs in programs. I'm the project lead of [MuBench][4], a benchmark dataset and pipeline for API-misuse detectors.
In the past, I've also been a core contributor to [the KaVE Software Campus project][5], in which we built a developer-assistance tool that helps developers learn and use third-party APIs quickly and correctly in their work.

I served on the following committees:

  * Organizing Committee of the [2nd International Workshop on API Usage and Evolution (WAPI '18)](https://w-api.github.io/2018/)
  * Organizing Committee of the [MSR '18 Mining Challenge](https://2018.msrconf.org/track/msr-2018-Mining-Challenge)
  * Organizing Committee of the [1st International Workshop on API Usage and Evolution (WAPI '17)](https://w-api.github.io/2017/)
  * Program Committee of the [FSE '17 Tool Demonstrations](http://esec-fse17.uni-paderborn.de/call_tooldemos.php)
  * Program Committee of the [MSR '17 Mining Challenge](http://2017.msrconf.org/#/challenge)
  * Program Committee of the [SANER '17 Tools Track](http://saner.aau.at/call-for-papers-tool-track/)

I am a teacher and student of Software Engineering topics in general. My activities include
