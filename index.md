I'm a developer and software quality consultant at [CQSE GmbH][cqse].
I'm also a teacher and student of Software Engineering topics in general.
My activities include
[university-level courses](http://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/staff/sven_amann/),
[Code Retreats](http://letsdeveloper.com/2015/03/1st-darmstadter-legacy-code-retreat/),
the blog [Academics Code](http://academicscode.com),
the YouTube channel [Let's Developer](http://youtube.com/letsdeveloper),
and individual consultancy.

I did PhD with Mira Mezini at the [Software Technology Group][stg] at TU Darmstadt, researching developer-assistance tools, bug detection, mining software repositories, and software testing.
I continue to do research on techniques that assist developers in assuring software quality.

I contribute to the following open source projects:

* I am the project lead of [MUBench][mubench], an open source automated benchmark for API-misuse detectors, i.e., tools that identify incorrect or non-optimal usages of APIs in program code.
* I am the project lead of [MUDetect][mudetect], an API-misuse detector.
* I was a core contributor to [the KaVE Software Campus project][kave], in which we built a developer-assistance tool that helps developers learn and use third-party APIs quickly and correctly in their work.

I received the following awards:

* [MSR'19 FOSS Impact Paper Special Mention Award]({{ site.url }}/publications/foss-impact-award-msr19.jpeg) for the work presented in my paper [Investigating Next Steps In Static API Misuse Detection](http://sven-amann.de/publications/2019-03-Investigating-Next-Steps-In-Static-API-Misuse-Detection/)

I served on the following committees:

  * Organizing Committee of the [2nd International Workshop on API Usage and Evolution (WAPI '18)](https://w-api.github.io/2018/)
  * Organizing Committee of the [MSR '18 Mining Challenge](https://2018.msrconf.org/track/msr-2018-Mining-Challenge)
  * Organizing Committee of the [1st International Workshop on API Usage and Evolution (WAPI '17)](https://w-api.github.io/2017/)
  * Program Committee of the [FSE '17 Tool Demonstrations](http://esec-fse17.uni-paderborn.de/call_tooldemos.php)
  * Program Committee of the [MSR '17 Mining Challenge](http://2017.msrconf.org/#/challenge)
  * Program Committee of the [SANER '17 Tools Track](http://saner.aau.at/call-for-papers-tool-track/)
